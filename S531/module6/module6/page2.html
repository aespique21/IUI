            <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
            <p>I love all Filipino food, but my favorite has to be pancit malabon, which is a type of noodle that is savory and salty, but the saltiness depends on how you like it. My mom makes it just right. A good amount of savory and salty. Shanghai is also a favorite for me, which is a type of egg roll made with ground pork and some finely chopped vegetables.</p>
