            <h2>Quick Introduction</h2> My name is Alyssa Espique. I am a third year computer science major attending IUPUI who is also minoring in business. Other than being a student, I consider my self to be very introverted, but with some time, I will become the completed opposite, so don't be fooled. I am adventurous at heart and constantly seek out new experiences and challenges to push my boundaries and grow as an individual. Though this is great to do alone, I love having my cousins or friends join me in the adventure.
