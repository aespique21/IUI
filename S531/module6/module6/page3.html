            <h2>Interests</h2>- Traveling: I enjoy exploring new destinations and immersing myself in diverse cultures through their cuisines, traditions, and activities. Delving into their history at museums and engaging with local residents enhances my traveling experience. <br> <br>- Watching Movies/Tv Shows: I find joy in exploring new places, but I also like the relaxation and enjoyment I experience when I am at home or at a theater watching a movie or show. <br> <br>- Being Outside: I love partaking in outdoor activities with friends and cousins, whether it's playing sports, hiking, or simply enjoying games and physical activities like throwing a ball around.
